              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                We love Iceland for couples, and it shows. With more than <a href="https://www.ferdamalastofa.is/is/um-ferdamalastofu/frettir/spakerfi-fyrir-ferdathjonustuna-fyrstu-nidurstodur" className="text-blue-1">2.3 million tourists</a> in 2023, Iceland appeals to an ever-growing worldwide audience. Here's why:
              </div>
              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Truly unique destination: <span className="text-15 text-light-4 fw-400">Whether you're traveling with your other half for a honeymoon trip or an anniversary escape, Iceland is not like Venice or Paris.

Couples can share the excitement of exploring jaw-dropping landscapes that pop up everywhere and immerse themselves in impromptu photo stops.</span></li>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Something for everyone: <span className="text-15 text-light-4 fw-400">Whether you enjoy the city or the countryside, an Iceland holiday package offers it all. If you think that Iceland is just for the adventurers, think again. Yes, the quests are endless, but there are also ample opportunities for relaxation, history, culture, food, and peacefulness.</span></li>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Full itinerary with a wide variety: <span className="text-15 text-light-4 fw-400">If lying all day on the beach is not your cup of tea, Iceland holiday packages will fill a seven, ten, or fourteen-day detailed itinerary and still leave things out for your next visit. From self-drive tours with a rental car to complete guided tours to the great outdoors, your Icelandic getaway awaits.</span></li>

              <h2 className="text-20 fw-500 mt-20">What Time of the Year is Iceland the Most Beautiful?</h2>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                The great thing about Iceland is that it's gorgeous year-round. No matter when you visit, each season has something different to offer. It all comes down to your desired itinerary.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                For example, if you visit from September to March, you'll be able to spot the northern lights or immerse yourself in the country's geothermal spas when they're less busy. On the other hand, visiting between June and August is ideal if you want warmer temperatures, long days of sunlight (the midnight sun), and whale watching.
              </div>
              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">
                  <img src={blog?.sub_img2} alt="image" className="rounded-4" />
                </div>
              </div>
              {/* End second */}

              <h2 className="text-20 fw-500 mt-20">When's the Best Time to See the Northern Lights in Iceland?</h2>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Witnessing the northern lights is one of the most mesmerizing experiences you can have with your significant other. Imagine a kiss under the Aurora Borealis in the shimmering black sky. Perfection!
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                To witness this miraculous natural phenomenon, you must plan your Icelandic adventure between September and April. This is when long, dark nights take over from bright summer nights, giving you a larger window to witness itâ€”the more the darkness, the merrier.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Usually, the Aurora Borealis is most active during the equinoxes in September and March. But there are still chances to witness it during mid-winter. A guided tour can help you plan your entire trip accordingly.
              </div>
              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">

              <h2 className="text-20 fw-500 mt-20">What is the Cheapest Month to Visit Iceland?</h2>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Iceland is a sought-after destination and a notoriously expensive country. However, this shouldn't be an obstacle to planning affordable holiday packages. You can always secure Iceland deals, optimal flight price, and self-drive tours to save money.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                The cheapest time to visit the land of ice and fire is during low season, between September to November and January to May. This is when prices are kinder to your wallet, and you can enjoy the most popular attractions without the masses. Win-win!
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                For example, car rentals that might overstretch your budget in June are not an issue in September. So, you get the best of both worlds. Additionally, tour operators, accommodations, meals, and even souvenirs tend to be cheaper during low season compared to peak months.
              </div>
              {/* End second */}

              <h2 className="text-20 fw-500 mt-20">How Many Days Do You Need to Explore Reykjavik?</h2>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                If you're visiting Iceland, having a more extended trip than just a day or two is worth it. No matter which seasons you're traveling, we recommend planning at least seven days for your Iceland holiday. This is the bare minimum time to see Reykjavik and other significant landmarks.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                If you want to drive around the entire island with a rental car, the Ring Road is about 1332km (828 miles), which will take at least one week. Ideally, plan 10-14 days, so your holiday won't feel rushed, and youâ€™ll have time to see places off the beaten path.
              </div>
              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
