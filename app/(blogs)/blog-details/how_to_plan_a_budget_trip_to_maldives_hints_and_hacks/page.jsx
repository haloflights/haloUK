              <h2 className="text-20 fw-500 mt-30 text-center">10+1 Tips on How to Travel Maldives on a Budget</h2>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                If you did some research on the Maldives 1-week trip cost and feel overwhelmed, fear not. Let's find out how to plan a budget trip to Maldives for your <a href="/honeymoon_holidays/maldives" className="text-blue-1">romantic getaway</a>:
              </div>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Travel During Off-season</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">The peak season in the Maldives is between December and April when there are more extended periods of sunshine and little rain. The best way to save money during your Maldives holiday is to travel between May and November during the off-season.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">That's when flight tickets and accommodation prices tend to lower significantly. This is the monsoon season with lots of tropical rainfall. However, visiting Maldives is still pleasant thanks to the country's position on the equator and its constant high temperatures at 30°C.</p>
              </ul>
              {/* End second */}

                </div>
              </div>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Cut on Airport Transfers</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Not all of us can afford a luxury jet to the Maldives, so the next best way is to reach the country by air. Flights to Malé International Airport will never be cheap, so instead, you can opt for one (or two) stopovers, which will reduce your international airport costs significantly.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Although flight deals to the Maldives have ticked down in recent years, we suggest booking with an expert Maldives travel agent. Try making your reservation at least 4-6 months before the travel dates to secure optimal deals.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Stay on Public Islands - the Best Place to Stay in Maldives on a Budget</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">A cheap travel package to the Maldives starts with affordable accommodation. There are two types of islands in the Maldives: public and private ones. Private islands are for luxury holiday packages and require hefty amounts of dollars.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">On the other hand, public local islands are ideal for travellers on a tight budget. That's because even the pricier hotel or guesthouse is significantly more affordable than the cheaper overwater bungalow. Plus, you can enjoy a more authentic experience where you can pick your own dining, shopping, and activity options and immerse yourself in local culture.</p>
              </ul>

              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">
                  <img src={blog?.sub_img2} alt="image" className="rounded-4" />
                </div>
              </div>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Choose More Affordable Islands</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Believe it or not, not all Maldives islands are pricey. On the contrary, you can spot backpack-friendly islands, which is perfect if you want to avoid luxury resorts. As a general rule of thumb, the further you go from crowds, the more affordable your accommodation budget will be.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">The most popular budget-friendly trip islands are Maafushi, Dhigurah, Huraa, Rasdhoo, Fulidhoo, Thulusdhoo, and Ukulhas. They're full of guesthouses and local experiences that'll significantly reduce your average Maldives trip cost.</p>
              </ul>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Avoid Island Hopping</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">You might be able to secure the best Maldives holiday packages and end up busting your budget to get from one island to the other. We recommend avoiding island hopping at all costs and focusing on one island at a time.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Even if you find cheap accommodation on two separate islands, you'll end up spending the money you saved (or even more) on transfers. If you really want to split your time between islands, ensure they're at least in the same atoll and connected with ferries.</p>
              </ul>

              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Opt for Local Transportation</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Probably our top tip on how to plan a trip to Maldives on a budget is travelling like a local. The local ferries are the state-run public transportation from Malé to various Maldives islands. While local speedboats can cost up to $25-$30 per ride, ferries cost around $1 to $4 per person per journey.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Although it might take longer to reach your destination, ferries offer a fantastic opportunity to sunbathe on the roof while watching dolphins. However, book tickets from ticket offices in advance during high season, as they tend to sell out. This will save you a fortune compared to speed boats and seaplanes.</p>
              </ul>

              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">

                </div>
              </div>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Bring Cash With You</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Bring US dollars in cash with you to secure better rates. The Maldives currency is Maldivian Rufiyaa or MVR. However, US dollars are also a legal tender accepted everywhere. In fact, many local shops and restaurants offer better deals when you pay in USD.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Additionally, paying by card is subject to extra fees, which you'll want to avoid. Also, remember that Maldives resorts have limited ATMs or banks. So, ensure you make some local currency as soon as you arrive at the airport.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Skip the Alcohol</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">The Maldives is a religious Muslim country, so alcohol is banned in local islands. You can drink alcohol on a private island, but it'll be extremely pricey due to the <a href="https://corporatemaldives.com/increase-in-tax-on-liquor-and-energy-drinks-amendment-to-the-export-import-act/" className="text-blue-1">25% tax</a>. This can be a deal breaker for many since the only way to drink is by arranging an excursion to a resort or a diving boat.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">If you want to save on your Maldives cost, you can abstain from drinking altogether. However, if that's out of the question, you can either book an all-inclusive Maldives holiday with a generous drink package or resort to semi-permanently anchored dive boats that serve alcohol.</p>
              </ul>

              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">

                </div>
              </div>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Buy a SIM card at the airport</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Using Wi-Fi while staying in your luxury resort is totally possible. However, once you're out of that Wi-Fi haven, you'll need to use your mobile data, and roaming costs tend to be itchy. To avoid extra charges, purchase a SIM card at the airport for as low as $10.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">This will cut your Maldives trip cost with a pay-as-you-go system covering you for over two weeks. Should you need to top-up, you can do so in the atolls.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Book Your Water Sports in Advance</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">If you're into thrilling water activities, there are two ways you can go about it. Option one is booking your diving excursions in advance by hunting the best Maldives package deals. Work the rest of your trip around those activities to reduce average costs.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Option two is asking your guesthouse host for scuba diving suggestions. They usually provide significant discounts for buying package deals in advance, allowing them to plan their dive schedules better. But make sure to ask other guesthouses as well to get an idea of the going rate.</p>
                <li className="fw-600">Go for an All-inclusive Deal</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Our top tip for your Maldives trip is to opt for all-inclusive Maldives holidays. Although it might sound counter-intuitive, all-inclusive holidays will cut a big chunk from taxes, food, drink, accommodation, and import fees.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">That's because hotels buy food and drink in large quantities to save on rates and charge lower fees for it. As a result, you get to enjoy all-inclusive meal plans and save on transportation when eating outside your hotel.</p>

              <h2 className="text-20 fw-500 mt-30 text-center">FAQs</h2>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Can the Maldives Be Done on a Budget?</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Absolutely! Planning a romantic getaway to the Maldives is totally doable. Make sure to travel off-season, arrange an all-inclusive Maldives holidays deal, transport with local ferries, and stay in public islands.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Which Area is Best to Stay in Maldives?</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">If you want the ultimate Maldives resort package, opt for accommodation in overwater bungalows and water villas. However, if you're budget-conscious, local islands are the best area to stay. Opt for hotels and guesthouses for half the price you'd pay for your own island and immerse yourself in the local culture and activities.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Is Maldives Expensive for Food?</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Prices for meals in the Maldives depend on the level of luxury you'll opt for. For example, meals can range from $20-$100+ in resorts and hotels. We recommend booking an all-inclusive package deal if you're budget-conscious and want to cut out on your one-week trip to the Maldives.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">How Do I Plan for Maldives?</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">To plan for your Maldives holiday, book cheap flights at least 4-6 months before your trip. For budget-friendly accommodation options, stay in hotels and guesthouses on public islands. In the meantime, scan the web for water sports activity deals and guided tours that'll cut costs significantly. You can optionally book your travel insurance for safe travel.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">What Month is the Maldives Cheapest?</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">The best months to visit the Maldives are between May and November, considered low season. Although this is the rainy time of the year, it's still pleasant to visit, thanks to the high temperatures at around 30°C.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Which is the Cheapest Island in Maldives?</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">For your budget-friendly Maldives holiday, opt for more affordable islands such as Maafushi Island, Dhigurah, Huraa, Rasdhoo, and Fulidhoo. Avoid luxury holidays on private islands, which can quickly break your bank.</p>
