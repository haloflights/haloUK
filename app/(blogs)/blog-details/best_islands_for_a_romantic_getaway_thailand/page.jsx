              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                We can't deny that Bangkok is a gorgeous capital city and a must for your Thailand trip. But if you're a beach lover and an island kid at heart, you'll be better off the shore. Here are the best places in Thailand for couples:
              </div>
              <h3 className="text-18 fw-500 mt-20">1. Koh Lipe for Laid-back Holidays</h3>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Koh Lipe is nothing short of idyllic if you're looking for an off-the-beaten-track destination. Lose all schedules and agendas here as you immerse in total relaxation in one of the lesser-known parts of Thailand.
              </div>
              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">
                  <img src={blog?.sub_img1} alt="image" className="rounded-4" />
                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Koh Lipe is more of a backpacker destination than a luxury resort, which is why it's charming. There are no cars on the island and very few roads, so you can stroll the streets in serenity without the noise and pollution. If it strikes your fancy, you can hop on a taxi boat ride to different island parts.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Your days here will be filled with swims alongside tropical creatures, sunbathing on powdery beaches, and savoring Thai cuisine. The waters will remind you of the <a href="/all_inclusive_holidays/maldives" className="text-blue-1">Maldives</a>, and the vibrant coral reefs will transport you to another world.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                What's romantic:

              {/* End second */}

              <h3 className="text-18 fw-500 mt-20">2. Phi Phi Islands for Stunning Beaches</h3>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Arguably one of the most popular islands and one of the best places in Thailand for couples. This cluster of six islands in the heart of the Andaman Sea combines limestone rock formations, dazzling waters, and luxury spas for total rejuvenation.
              </div>
              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">

              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Picture sinking into a hammock in your partner's hug with a cocktail at hand amid the lush tropical vegetation. Stop it; you'll make us blush! Koh Pai Island (also known as Bamboo Island) is literally shaped like a heart for hopeless romantics. Need more proof you should visit?
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Similar to other islands on our list, Phi Phi Islands offer incredible viewpoints for an overview of the iconic scenery. Meanwhile, Koh Phi Phi Lee was the island where the famous Leonardo DiCaprio's movie The Beach was shot, so it tends to get super crowded.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">

              <h3 className="text-18 fw-500 mt-20">3. Koh Tao for the Vivid Nightlife</h3>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                We're super excited about this next recommendation for your all-inclusive Thailand holidays! Koh Tao is the epitome of breathtaking views due to its mountainous terrain. Popular viewpoints such as Suwan, Grape, and Mango offer a true feast for the eyes and cameras.
              </div>
              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">
                  <img src={blog?.sub_img3} alt="image" className="rounded-4" />
                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                During the daytime, you can immerse yourself in water sports like scuba diving for bargain prices or enjoy a boat trip around the island. At night, you'll find countless lantern-lit restaurants for dreamy dinners with your lover.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Thai cuisine is delectable - think smokey pork with garlic and chilli or a soothing bowl of tom yum soup with shrimp. Finger-licking!
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                What's romantic:

              <h3 className="text-18 fw-500 mt-20">4. Koh Samui for Luxurious All-Inclusive Thailand Holidays</h3>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                If you want to sparkle up your romance in a more convenient setting, Koh Samui is the largest and most popular island on the East Coast. Although a bit more commercialized than other Thailand destinations, it balances tranquility and excitement perfectly.
              </div>
              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">

                </div>
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Here, you'll find luxurious resorts, massage huts, and beach bungalows at your fingertips. Craving traditional Thai cuisine? You got it! Looking to unwind in the day while partying at night? You're at the right place!
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Although Koh Samui gathers partygoers and buzzy crowds among other audiences, it's still possible to spot heavenly quiet coves. So even if you don't want to have a rave-party at night but slow dance with your special someone under the moonlight, it's totally possible.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                What's romantic:

              <h3 className="text-18 fw-500 mt-20">5. Mu Koh Lanta National Park for the Delectable Cuisine</h3>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
              Yet another group of islands established as a national park in the 90s. For those looking to blend in with the locals, Mu Koh Lanta is home to friendly fishing villages where warm people will greet you with the biggest of smiles.
              </div>
              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">

              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
              This is the epitome of Thailand for couples and the perfect opportunity to get an authentic taste of how people live there. Especially if you're into fishing, you'll be amazed by the colourful long-tail fish boats, the tropical catches, and the delicious seafood dinners.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
              You can even take cooking classes to add a playful aura to your romantic trip. If you fancy sprinkling some activities into your stay, you can kayak through the stunning mangrove forest or do some island hopping.
