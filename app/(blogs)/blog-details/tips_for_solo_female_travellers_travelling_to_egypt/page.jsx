              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Egypt's reputation proceeds it, and we're not talking about the pyramids. If you live in the Western world, you've probably seen government and media warnings discouraging tourists from visiting. Even the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/egypt/safety-and-security" className="text-blue-1">UK government</a> expressed its fears of terrorist attacks in the area.
              </div>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                Truth be told, Egypt has a moderate level of safety. And although it's totally possible to have safe travels there, taking some precautions is mandatory. So, let's address the elephant in the room and see what are the biggest challenges you might face while travelling to Egypt as a woman:

              <h2 className="text-20 fw-500 mt-30 text-center">7 Tips for Safety in Egypt (Solo Female Travellers Edition)</h2>
              <div className="text-15 mt-20">
                So, is it safe to travel to Egypt as a woman? Here are our top tips to ensure safe, all-inclusive Egypt holidays:
              </div>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Dress Modestly</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Egypt is a Muslim country, so women here dress conservatively. Your goal as a solo female traveller in Egypt should be to pass under the radars of people. Wearing scandalous clothes, or even summer clothes when it's hot, will draw unnecessary attention, and you don't want that.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Not to mention that you should respect the local culture. So put some effort into how you dress, as this will determine a huge part of how you're treated in the streets. Ensure you cover your shoulders, upper arms, chest, and legs, and wear loose-fitting clothes (which will also keep you cool under the sun).</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Book a Safe Hotel</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Book a hotel with security checks at all entrances for maximum safety in Egypt. You don't want to risk an unexpected break-in to your apartment at night, do you? Thankfully, there are many safe, family-owned hotels in Egypt where the staff won't only welcome you but also care for you.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Our best tip for Egypt's safety is to book all-inclusive Egypt holidays. Entrust your accommodation to the experts who will guide you on where to stay and book the best of the best stays for your trip. This can save you from many hazards and dangers you might not know.</p>
              </ul>
              {/* End second */}

              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">
                  <img src={blog?.sub_img2} alt="image" className="rounded-4" />
                </div>
              </div>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Book Local Female Tour Guides</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Although we applaud you for your courage to experience Egypt solo, we highly recommend joining forces with other local female tour operators who'll understand and guide you. In fact, you can hire a local female driver and guide for very little money and feel more confident about your stay there.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">These women have been taking strict training in Egyptology for years and will be your trusted sources of information about anything Egypt-related. Plus, they speak the common tongue if your Arabic is poor. You can easily acquire them at the front desk of your hotel or ask your travel agent to provide you with one.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Take a Safe Transportation</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">If you're travelling to Cairo, you'll be happy to know that it offers a safe and clean metro station. And more than that, since Egypt is a Muslim country, women have their own wagons (usually the first and second wagons of each train). We dare say it's a fantastic experience to mingle with local women and get greeted by warm smiles.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">The second safest way to get around in big cities is via Uber. Rides are ridiculously cheap (around $1-$3), and you'll feel safe keeping track of the route and the driver.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">If you take a taxi, always agree on the price before entering. A great tip is to always carry your hotel business card with you. So even if you get lost, and your Arabic is bad, you can give it to the driver, and they can take you back to your hotel.</p>
              </ul>

              <div className="row y-gap-30 pt-30">
                <div className="col-md-12">

                </div>
              </div>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Look Confident</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Carrying yourself confidently is probably one of the most essential tips for travelling in Egypt as a woman. Don't feel confident? Fake it till you make it. Keep your chin and your eyes up, and move calmly. It also helps to know where you're going; avoid looking confused and spinning around with your GPS.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">It's essential always to purchase a SIM card from the airport to have your data available. Before you leave a place, track your destination with your GPS and know which route you'll follow. If it helps, you can also wear a fake wedding ring to make you look like you're travelling with a partner.</p>
                <li className="mt-10 fw-600">Ignore Local Vendors</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Popular tourist areas are packed with local vendors aggressively trying to sell products. Especially if you're visiting alone without a local guide, be ready to get bombarded. Our best tip? Ignore them. They'll typically give up if they see you unresponsive.</p>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Don't get into the trap of buying what they offer to support them. You'll be encountered with unreasonable prices and scams. Also, always mind your personal belongings, as people might try to steal things from you while selling you products.</p>
              </ul>

              <ul className="list-disc text-15 mt-10">
                <li className="fw-600">Book All-Inclusive Egypt Holidays</li>
                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">Travelling to Egypt as a woman comes with its risks.

                <p className="text-14 text-light-4 fw-400">An all-inclusive package will secure a safe hotel, quality meals and drinks, fun activities, and entertainment options.

              </ul>

              <div className="text-15 mt-20 fw-600">For an unforgettable solo journey, remember that preparation and mindfulness are key. Embrace the empowering experience of exploring Egypt independently, and always prioritize your safety and comfort while enjoying the wonders this incredible country has to offer.</div>
